# MC Client++

## Introduction

[MC Client++](https://github.com/RooftopJoe/mcclient++) is a client-side semivanilla Minecraft utility mod that provides numerous
features which aim to improve the player's quality of life as well as expose a plethora of in-game information to them. As such, it
does not change any of the vanilla mechanics nor does it add any content to the game.

Some of the features provided by this mod may be considered a form of cheating on some servers so be sure to check with the admins to
see whether you are allowed to use them on said servers. Furthermore, the use of this mod is prohibited in official speedruns.
